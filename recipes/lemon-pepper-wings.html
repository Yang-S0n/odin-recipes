    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p id="description">My family and I love lemon-pepper wings, especially during football season. 
            I got tired of spending so much money on them for our party that I decided to whip up my own version of Wingstop's lemon-pepper chicken wings. 
            The end result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>12 chicken wings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 2: Stir olive oil and lemon-pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Fry wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes; 
            an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 4: Toss hot wings with lemon-pepper mixture to coat.</li>
    </ul>
